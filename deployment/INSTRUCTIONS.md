# Deployment

So you're ready to set Postfacto up, choose names for your web and API apps. We'll refer to these names as `api-app-name` and `web-app-name` from now on.
If you're deploying to [Pivotal Web Services](#pivotal-web-services), you can check they are available by making sure there is an error when visiting `your-chosen-name.cfapps.io`.

## Pivotal Web Services

[Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io) provides a hosted version of Pivotal's [Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform) platform and is probably the easiest place to get Postfacto up and running. You can use [Concourse](https://concourse.ci) to deploy and keep your instance up to date using the example `pipeline.yml` in `pws` or if you'd prefer you can set it up manually using the steps below:

1. Sign up for a PWS account, install the CF CLI and set yourself up with an organization and space by following the instructions [here](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/starting/)
1. Once logged in to PWS, add a database and a Redis service instance to your space from the Marketplace. We recommend the free plans of ElephantSQL and Redis Cloud respectively for this. Name these services `postfacto-db` and `postfacto-redis`
1. In `pws/config/manifest-api.yml`, change the `{{api-app-name}}` and `{{web-app-name}}` to be your `api-app-name` and `web-app-name`
1. In `pws/config/manifest-web.yml`, change the `{{web-app-name}}` to be your `web-app-name`
1. In `pws/config/config.js`, change the `{{api-app-name}}` to be your `api-app-name`
1. In `pws/deploy.sh`, change the `{{api-app-name}}` to be your `api-app-name`

1. Run the PWS deployment script from the `pws` directory:

  ```bash
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

1. Log in to the admin dashboard (email: `email@example.com` and password: `password`) to check everything has worked at `api-app-name.cfapps.io/admin`
1. Create a retro for yourself by clicking on 'Retros' and the 'New Retro'
1. Log in to your retro at `web-app-name.cfapps.io/retros/you-retro-slug`
1. Share the URL and password with your team and then run a retro!

## Pivotal Cloud Foundry

You can use [Concourse](https://concourse.ci) to deploy and keep your instance up to date using the example pipeline in `deployments/pcf` or if you'd prefer you can set it up manually using the steps below:

1. Set yourself up with an organization and space in your PCF to deploy your Postfacto to.
1. Take note of your PCF url, going forward referred to as `pcf-url`
1. Add a database (Postgres or Mysql) and a Redis service instance to your space from the Marketplace. Name these services `postfacto-db` and `postfacto-redis`.
1. In `pcf/config/manifest-api.yml`, change the `{{api-app-name}}`, `{{web-app-name}}`, `{{pcf-url}}` to be your `api-app-name`, `web-app-name` and `pcf-url`
1. In `pcf/config/manifest-web.yml`, change the `{{web-app-name}}` to be your `web-app-name`
1. In `pcf/config/config.js`, change the `{{api-app-name}}`, `{{web-app-name}}`, and `{{pcf-url}}` to be your `api-app-name`, `web-app-name`, and `pcf-url`
1. In `pcf/deploy.sh`, change the `{{api-app-name}}` to be your `api-app-name`

1. Run the PCF deployment script from the `pcf` directory:

  ```bash
  ./deploy.sh
  ```

1. Log in to the admin dashboard (email: `email@example.com` and password: `password`) to check everything has worked at `api-app-name.{{pcf-url}}/admin`
1. Create a retro for yourself by clicking on 'Retros' and the 'New Retro'
1. Log in to your retro at `web-app-name.{{pcf-url}}/retros/you-retro-slug`
1. Share the URL and password with your team and then run a retro!

## Optional Setup

### Setting up Google OAuth

In order for users to sign-up and create their own retros using the web UI, Postfacto needs Google OAuth setup.
For deployments that do not want to setup Google OAuth, you will need to create your retros through the admin console of your server via
`api-app-name.cfapps.io/admin` or `api-app-name.{{pcf-url}}/admin`.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and
   create a new project
1. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth client ID > Web application
1. Choose a name for your app
1. In `Authorized JavaScript Origins`, set it to the public URL of your `web-app-name`.  For example: if deploying to PWS, your public URL will be `https://{{web-app-name}}.cfapps.io`
1. You can leave redirect blank
1. Take note of your `client-id` that is generated
1. In additional to the steps required for deploying to PWS, and PCF:
   - For PWS, in `pws/config/config.js`, add the
     line `"google_oauth_client_id": {{client-id}}` to the config object, and change
`{{client-id}}` to your generated Google OAuth `client-id`
   - For PCF, in `pcf/config/config.js`, add the
     line `"google_oauth_client_id": {{client-id}}` to the config object, and change
`{{client-id}}` to your generated Google OAuth `client-id`
